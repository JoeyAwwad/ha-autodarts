# Changelog

All notable changes of the Autodarts integration. The complete notes of every version, with each pull request, are on the [releases page](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/releases); what comes next is in the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md). Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 1.7.1

### Fixed

- **No error in the log when Home Assistant restarts:** a board poll that started after Home Assistant had closed its connections logged *Unexpected error fetching autodarts_local data* with a traceback. It now counts as an ordinary lost connection, like the event stream, the camera stream and the cloud requests. Reported by @JoeyAwwad in #107.
- **Board settings show at once:** with Board Manager 1, a setting switched on or off, such as *Auto distortion*, could show its old value for up to 30 seconds when a poll was reading the settings at that moment.

### Documentation

- **Autodarts Desktop on Linux** is listed under the supported devices: a player reported version 2.0.2 on Ubuntu 24.04 working with every feature (#105). Autodarts Desktop on Windows is still untested; a compatibility report helps.

## 1.7.0

### New

- **Where a corrected dart really is:** the scoreboard's pad has a new *🎯 Board* view. Tap the spot where the dart is, and the bed and the position come in one step; a dashed ring shows where the board saw the dart. The keypad for darts entered by hand uses it too. `autodarts.correct_dart` and `autodarts.throw_dart` take the position as `x` and `y`, and the bed follows from it.

### Improved

- **Live dart positions:** the positions heatmap of the training card shows the darts of the current visit the moment they land, as blue pins, and loads the logged darts again as soon as you pull them, instead of a visit later.
- **Clean positions after corrections:** where the board misread a bed, it misread the spot as well. A dart corrected into another bed therefore leaves the board's position behind and stays out of the dart positions, the grouping and a bull-off by distance, unless the correction says where the dart is.

## 1.6.0

### New

- **More games:** Cut-Throat Cricket and Tactics; the party games Golf (9 or 18 holes), Baseball and Count-Up; the training games 121 checkout, Catch 40, JDC Challenge and singles training.
- **Handicap and teams:** every player can start X01 from a score of their own, and four players play X01 or a Cricket game as two teams of two.
- **Tournaments** for three to eight players at one board: a round robin with a table or a knockout with a bracket, in X01 with start scores or a Cricket game; the next match starts by itself, the results go into the player profiles, and `autodarts.start_tournament`, `autodarts.next_tournament_match` and `autodarts.stop_tournament` run them from automations.
- **Match summary:** after an X01 or Cricket match, the scoreboard and the live card show every player's averages, checkout rate, highest checkout, 180s and best leg; `match_won` carries the numbers, and the winner's banner names the result, such as 3 : 2.
- **A bot** to play X01 and the Cricket games against, from level 20 to 120: it aims like a player, its darts land with a scatter calibrated to its 3-dart average and show on the cards, and it never counts in your statistics. Seat it on the new game screen, with *Practice bot level* or with `bot_level` of `autodarts.start_game`.
- **Corrections and darts entered by hand:** a tap on a dart of the scoreboard, or `autodarts.correct_dart`, corrects a dart the board read wrong; with *Practice manual entry*, a keypad or `autodarts.throw_dart` enters darts the board missed; `autodarts.next_player` passes the turn, and `autodarts.undo_visit` takes the last visit back, with the new `visit_undone` event.
- **Setup hints:** where the darts left cannot check out, the cards, `turn_changed` and the callers suggest a setup that leaves a good double, such as T20 T20 S17 to leave 32.
- **Achievements** in bronze, silver, gold and platinum, from the first 180 to a nine-darter, with the `achievement_unlocked` event and badges on the players card.
- **Player progress:** twelve weeks of trends per player, a heatmap of the real dart positions for the session or any player, the grouping of the darts in millimeters, and a new leaderboard card with the records of all players.
- **A game lobby on the scoreboard:** a new game screen to choose the game, the players and the format at the board, idle mode with a leaderboard, personal bests, today's darts, the last match and a clock, and the pictures of players linked to persons of Home Assistant with `autodarts.link_player` and `autodarts.unlink_player`.
- **Reports:** a weekly report with its sensor, the `weekly_report` event and a blueprint; a training calendar of the last 365 days; `autodarts.export` and an export button on the players card for CSV or JSON.
- **Highlights and light:** a highlight gallery in the media browser, fed by the highlight photo blueprint, and a new light show blueprint for WLED and room lights.
- **Online matches** *(experimental)*: an optional bridge brings busts, won legs and matches and the darts of opponents on play.autodarts.io into Home Assistant through the browser extension Tools for Autodarts.
- **Dutch, French and Spanish:** the integration, the cards and the caller speak three more languages.
- **Events in time:** `visit_thrown` announces a visit the moment its third dart lands; dart and visit events name the game and the player.
- **Bull-off by distance:** optionally, the measured distance also decides between two darts in the same bull bed. The scoreboard shows the bed and the distance of every dart and who leads.
- **Double out from the next leg:** switching double out during a leg applies from the next leg, so no leg becomes unwinnable.

### Improved

- **Official rules:** the throw alternates within a set and every set starts with the next player, as in PDC set play; a match ends 3–2 instead of losing the legs of the deciding set; checkout routes follow the professional charts; highest checkout and fewest darts count only legs with double out; Killer and Shanghai follow their rules in every detail.
- **Cards:** Home Assistant's own editor forms with color pickers, an editor for the automatic dashboard, personal bests on the training card, numbers, dates and times in the formats of your profile, a caller that calls only what counts, and better keyboard and screen reader support.
- **Connection:** visits and entities survive short connection faults; realtime reconnects with a back-off; a board that is off at the start no longer blocks the setup; repairs for a board that refuses access, answers in an unknown format or moved to a new address.
- **Entities:** clearer names without a repeated "Board", diagnostic and configuration categories where they belong, and complete diagnostics without player names.
- **Safe statistics:** a board whose stored training cannot be read right now, or was saved by a newer version, waits instead of starting empty, so its data is never overwritten. Every leg and visit counts once in the statistics, undo also rewinds the progress, the weekly report and the calendar, and in a team match only the player who checks out gets the checkout.
- **Rules:** Golf counts a double as a hole in one and a triple as two strokes; in the checkout training, the 121 checkout and Catch 40 a bust voids only its visit, the 121 checkout plays every score up to 170, and Catch 40 scores 3 points for 99 in three darts; Cut-Throat Cricket checks the win after every dart; a tournament hands the practice game its players and settings back when it ends; the bot plays Cricket at the marks per round of its level.
- **Scoreboard:** fits every screen, with the pad and the keypad beside the scores on a full-height screen in landscape; starting a game in the lobby also starts the detection; the automatic dashboard sets the scoreboard's caller, keypad, corrections, lobby games and idle panels without taking control; the training card's chart follows the history live, and an undone visit leaves it.
- **Actions and security:** deleting, linking and exporting the players' data are administrator actions, which automations still run; exports go to the media folder by default, only to folders where Home Assistant allows writing and at most 20 an hour; a board found at a new address moves only after you confirm a repair; the highlight gallery shows small thumbnails; invalid values of an action get a message in your language.
- **Quieter entities:** *Last event* and *CPU usage*, which change all the time, start disabled on boards set up from now on.
- **Blueprints:** the visit score and the light show leave the bot out unless you turn on *Also for the bot*, and the callers and the light show name it "Bot" like the scoreboard; the highlight photo hands the saved photo to your notification as `photo_url`; the light show keeps up to nine moments waiting behind an effect, reacts to the takeout only when you ask, and never pauses the detection in the middle of a visit; player names never become templates.
- Brand icons and logos in the sizes of the Home Assistant brand specification.

### Documentation

- A new structure with illustrated guides for [games and rules](docs/games.md), the [scoreboard at the board](docs/scoreboard.md), [statistics and players](docs/statistics.md) and [online matches](docs/online-matches.md), a [glossary](docs/glossary.md) in English and German and an accessibility section in the card guide.
