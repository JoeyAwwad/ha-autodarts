Every guide is on the [documentation website](https://dennis-otto.github.io/ha-autodarts/), in English and [German](https://dennis-otto.github.io/ha-autodarts/de/), with a search.

## Why

- **Instant and local.** Darts appear in Home Assistant a fraction of a second after they land, straight from the Board Manager in your network. No account, no cloud, no client ID.
- **A whole darts evening.** X01 from 101 to 1001, four Cricket games, six party games and eight training games, alone, as a match of up to four or as a tournament of up to eight, with a scoreboard for the tablet at the board.
- **Your progress in numbers.** Averages, heatmaps of the real dart positions, personal bests, badges, weekly trends, player profiles, a weekly report and a year of history, all kept in your home.
- **Your home plays along.** Lights for a 180, a caller on your speakers, the board light for the takeout, a photo of your best checkout.

## Requirements

**Home Assistant 2026.8 or newer** with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz), and an Autodarts board in your network: **Board Manager 2**, Autodarts 2 without a screen (recommended, tested up to 2.0.2), or the classic **Board Manager 1**. A player reports that **Autodarts Desktop** 2.0.2 on Linux works too. Autodarts Desktop on Windows and the Winmau Autodarts devices such as Autodarts X or Lens have not been tested yet; a [compatibility report](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/issues/new?template=board_compatibility.yml) helps, whether it works or not. No Autodarts account is needed.

## Quick start

1. **Install with HACS.**

   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and open this repository in HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Dennis-Otto&repository=ha-autodarts&category=integration)

   Or add `https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts` in HACS as a custom repository of the type **Integration**, then download **Autodarts**.
2. **Restart Home Assistant.**
3. **Add your board.** With Board Manager 2, Home Assistant usually shows it under **Settings → Devices & services → Discovered** already. Otherwise:

   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up Autodarts.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=autodarts)

   Choose **Search for boards on this network** or **Enter board address** and confirm.
4. **Add the cards.** Create a complete dashboard in one step: **Settings → Dashboards → Add dashboard → Autodarts**. Or edit a dashboard, choose **Add card** and search for *Autodarts*.

New to Home Assistant? [From zero to the scoreboard](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) takes you from nothing to the scoreboard next to your board. The [installation guide](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/blob/main/docs/installation.md) covers manual installation, reconfiguration, updates and removal.

## Blueprints

Import a blueprint with one click, choose your board and you're done:

| Blueprint | Import |
| --- | --- |
| **Light show.** Your WLED presets or room lights for a 180, a high finish, a bust, a won leg or match, a personal best, an achievement, the winner of a tournament and more, and back to your normal light afterwards. | [![Import the light show blueprint](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDennis-Otto%2Fha-autodarts%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fautodarts%2Flight_show.yaml) |

| **Training session routine.** Light, detection and calibration follow your training sessions. | [![Import the training session routine blueprint](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDennis-Otto%2Fha-autodarts%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fautodarts%2Ftraining_session.yaml) |
| **Weekly report.** Your training week with the trend of your 3-dart average, as a notification. | [![Import the weekly report blueprint](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDennis-Otto%2Fha-autodarts%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fautodarts%2Fweekly_report.yaml) |

## Known limitations

- **Cloud match data is on hold.** It needs an OAuth client ID that Autodarts issues for this integration, and none is bundled yet. Everything local works without it.
- **Online matches through a browser extension.** Busts and game shots of online matches arrive only while the Autodarts page is open with Tools for Autodarts, a third-party extension. [Limitations](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/blob/main/docs/online-matches.md#limitations).
- **Training sessions count darts, not games.** A session counts every dart the board detects; players, legs and checkouts belong to the practice game, which keeps its own statistics.
- **Board Manager updates are installed on the board PC.** The update entity reports new Board Manager 2 versions.
- **Live camera view with Board Manager 2 only.** With Board Manager 1, the camera entities show snapshots.

## Support and contributing

- **Questions and ideas:** [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/discussions). **Bugs:** [issues](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/issues/new/choose), with the diagnostics of your board. [SUPPORT.md](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) explains where to ask what.
- **Tried it?** A [tester report](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/issues/new?template=tester_report.yml) tells us what worked, what didn't and what you miss; short answers are fine.
- **Speak German, Dutch, French or Spanish?** The [translation issues](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Atranslations) name the texts that are missing or outdated in your language, and how to fix them in the browser, no programming needed.
- **Security:** report vulnerabilities privately as described in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
- **Show it:** for videos and articles, the [creator kit](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/blob/main/docs/creator-kit.md) has facts, videos and pictures, free to use.
- **Contributing:** contributions are welcome; [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) explains the checks. Participation follows the [code of conduct](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the project's [governance](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).

## Credits and license

This integration started as a fork of [Trkal/HACSAutodarts](https://github.com/Trkal/HACSAutodarts), a cloud-based prototype from April 2026. Since September 2026 it has been rewritten and is maintained independently by [@Dennis-Otto](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto): local realtime control for both Board Manager generations, games, training analytics, dashboard cards, blueprints, tests and documentation. Both use the `autodarts` domain; the [installation guide](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/blob/main/docs/installation.md#update-from-the-original-integration) explains how to switch. Thanks to Trkal for the original work and to the Autodarts team for their open local API.
