# Governance

This repository is an independent, community-oriented fork of [Trkal/HACSAutodarts](https://github.com/Trkal/HACSAutodarts), maintained by Dennis Otto. It is not affiliated with Autodarts.

## Maintainers and access

| Person | Role | Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [@Dennis-Otto](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto) | Maintainer | Repository administration, releases and the release automation's GitHub App, security advisories, the OpenSSF Best Practices entry and the HACS listing |

## Roles and responsibilities

| Role | Who | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maintainer | the people in the table above | Reads every issue and has the last word on it. Reviews the pull requests of others and merges pull requests. Answers vulnerability reports within the times of [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and publishes their advisories. Merges the release pull requests that wait for a person. Keeps the secrets, the settings as code and the accepted findings current, and the documentation true to the latest release. |
| Contributor | everybody who opens a pull request | Follows [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): tests for every new function and every fix, the coding standards, a sign-off on every commit and an entry under *Unreleased* for every change for users. |
| Reporter | everybody who opens an issue or reports a vulnerability | Names the release, the set-up and the steps to reproduce, answers the questions in the issue, and reports a vulnerability only privately. |
| Bots | the workflows in `.github/workflows/` | Do the routine work that [Automation](#automation) describes, each with the least permissions it needs. What they don't merge or publish on their own waits for the maintainer. |

## Decisions

Feature, compatibility and maintenance decisions are discussed in public GitHub issues, discussions and pull requests whenever they do not contain security-sensitive information. Decisions prioritize local control without cloud dependencies, secure handling of tokens and board credentials, compatibility with current Home Assistant releases, backward compatibility of existing config entries and entity IDs, and maintainability. The [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) records what comes next.

The maintainer has final responsibility for releases, repository access, security responses and project direction. Significant behavior changes include rationale, tests, documentation in English and German, and categorized release notes.

## Reviews

Every change reaches `main` through a pull request that passes all required checks: tests with a coverage gate, linting and typing, the Docker end-to-end tests, HACS and hassfest validation, the licenses of every file (REUSE), the sign-off of every commit, CodeQL, dependency review and the secret scan. Contributions from others are reviewed by the maintainer for correctness, tests, documentation, security and user impact before they are merged.

## Automation

Bots do the routine work, each with the least permissions it needs:

- **Renovate** updates the dependencies, the actions and the images, and Dependabot the Features of the dev container; routine updates merge on their own when every check passes.
- **The release bot** keeps a pull request for the next release, from the titles of the merged pull requests. A release of dependency updates merges and publishes itself; every other release waits for the maintainer.
- **The branch bot** brings every pull request that waits for auto-merge up to date after each change of `main`, so that it merges once its checks pass again.
- **The issue assistant** analyzes new issues, keeps their labels and lifecycle, and closes fixed issues with the release that ships the fix.
- **The Findings workflow** keeps the findings of code scanning either fixed or accepted with a reason.

## Contributions and maintainership

Contributions follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). An automated [issue assistant](docs/development.md#issue-assistant) posts a first analysis of new issues, labels them, closes likely duplicates after a notice and issues that wait for their reporter for 30 days; it never decides on behalf of the maintainer, who reads every issue. Sustained contributors may be invited to help triage issues or review changes. Maintainer access is granted only after a history of constructive, security-conscious contributions and may be removed when it is no longer needed.

## Continuity

If the current maintainer can no longer maintain the project, the preferred outcome is a transparent handover to a trusted active contributor, announced in the repository. Until that handover is complete, the repository should be archived rather than presented as actively maintained, so that users are not left with an unmaintained integration that still looks active.

The owner has designated a successor through [GitHub's account successor setting](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/maintaining-ownership-continuity-of-your-personal-accounts-repositories). Should the owner die, the successor can, once GitHub has confirmed it, transfer the repository to their own account or to an organization and carry it on there with administrator access, or archive it. With the maintainer and the successor, the bus factor of the project is 2. These keep the project able to continue as well:

- Everything that builds, tests, releases and protects the project is in this repository: the code and its tests, the workflows, the settings as code and the documentation. Anyone can fork it under its license and carry on.
- The bots keep the dependencies current and publish releases of dependency updates, as long as every check passes.

## Security

Potential vulnerabilities follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and are handled privately until a coordinated fix and disclosure are ready.
