English and German are both welcome. This community project has no guaranteed response times and offers no private operational support. It is not affiliated with Autodarts; problems with the board, its detection or your Autodarts account belong to Autodarts support.

## What happens with your issue

Within a few minutes, the repository's issue assistant labels a new issue and posts a first analysis: a summary, the likely cause or the documentation that helps, related issues and, if needed, questions. The assistant currently uses Claude, an AI by Anthropic; it reads the text of the issue and the public repository and can be wrong. The maintainer reads every issue and decides.

- **Questions** mark the issue as waiting for you. Answer in a comment or by editing the issue. Without an answer, a reminder follows after 15 days and the issue closes after 30 days; answering reopens it.
- **A likely duplicate** of an open issue gets a notice and closes 3 days later, so the conversation stays in one place. If it's something different, write a comment or react to the notice with 👎, and it stays open.
- **A fix** on `main` marks the issue `fixed-in-next-release`. It stays open until a release ships the fix, and then closes with a link to the release. If the problem persists after the update, write a comment within 30 days and the issue reopens.

The [development guide](docs/development.md#issue-assistant) describes the assistant in detail.
