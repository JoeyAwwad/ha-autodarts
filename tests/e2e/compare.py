"""Compare two folders of documentation images pixel by pixel.

visual.sh runs it after rendering the images anew: the images committed before
the run against those rendered. It writes, into the output folder:

- report.json: every image whose pixels changed, was added or removed, with the
  share of its pixels that changed, for the screenshot bot and the comment of the
  visual check;
- summary.md: the same as a table, for the summary of the workflow run;
- for every changed image, the image before and after and a picture of the
  difference: the image after in grey, every changed pixel in red.

Animated WebP images compare frame by frame, with the time each frame shows.
An image whose file changed but whose pixels did not counts as unchanged; with
--restore, its committed file comes back, so that only real changes remain.
