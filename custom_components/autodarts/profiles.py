"""Player profiles: statistics and personal bests per name, matches and head-to-head.

Profiles exist for named players only; a name is the same player regardless of
upper and lower case. Legs count in every game; X01 legs add the averages and
the checkout rate, Cricket legs the marks per round. The highest checkout and
the fewest darts come from X01 legs with double out only; the fewest darts
also only from legs a player played alone, from one of the X01 start scores.
