"""Hit rates of every double, the doubles a player finishes on best, and how
often every double was hit at all.

A dart counts as an attempt at a double when that double is the target: in
X01, the checkout training, 121 and Catch 40 when one double could finish the
remaining score, in the doubles training and in Bob's 27 at the double of the
round, and in the JDC Challenge at the double of the step. A hit counts for
every dart in a double, whatever it was aimed at.
