/*
 * Autodarts cards for Home Assistant, served by the Autodarts integration.
 *
 * - autodarts-card: the current visit on a dartboard drawn with the geometry of
 *   the Autodarts Board Manager. Hit beds blink, darts appear at their detected
 *   position and the board glows in the detection status colour.
 * - autodarts-training-card: the local training session with a hit heatmap,
 *   statistics, personal bests, the most hit beds and the recent visits.
 * - autodarts-status-card: detection, connections, cameras, the board PC and
 *   maintenance controls at a glance.
 * - autodarts-scoreboard-card, autodarts-players-card and autodarts-doubles-card:
 *   the game at the board, the player profiles and the hit rate per double.
 * - autodarts-leaderboard-card: records across all players, for all time, the
 *   last four weeks or this week.
 * - The dashboard strategy "custom:autodarts" builds a complete dashboard with
 *   live, scoreboard, training, players and board views for every board.
 *
 * Card editors are forms of Home Assistant (getConfigForm); only the strategy,
 * which Home Assistant offers no form for, brings its own editor element.
