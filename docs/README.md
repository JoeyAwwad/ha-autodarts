# Autodarts for Home Assistant: documentation

[← Project page](../README.md) · [Deutsche Dokumentation](de/README.md)

Everything about the Autodarts integration: how to set it up, play and train with it, put a scoreboard next to the board, follow your statistics and let your home join in.

## Supported devices

| | Supported | Tested with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Board Manager 2: Autodarts 2 without a screen (headless) | 2.x | 2.0.0 and 2.0.2 |
| Board Manager 1 (classic app) | 1.x | 1.0.7 |
| Autodarts Desktop on Linux | Works, as reported by a player | 2.0.2 on Ubuntu 24.04 ([report](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/issues/105)) |
| Autodarts Desktop on Windows and other systems | Not tested yet | – |
| Winmau Autodarts devices such as Autodarts X or Lens | Not tested yet | – |
| Cameras | Any number supported by the Board Manager | 3 |
| Home Assistant | 2026.8 or newer | 2026.8.0 and 2026.9.4 |

Any board hardware that runs the Autodarts Board Manager works, because the integration talks to the Board Manager, not to the cameras. Rows reported by a player were tested by a player on their own board, not by the project.

Since September 2026, the Autodarts documentation describes the Board Manager as the browser interface of Autodarts 0.x that is not supported from version 2 on. The local interface on port 3180 that the integration uses still answers on Autodarts 2.0.2. If an update changes it, the integration shows a repair notice instead of failing silently (see [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#repairs)). If your setup is not in the table, a [compatibility report](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/issues/new?template=board_compatibility.yml) helps, even when everything works.

## Languages

The integration speaks English, German, Dutch, French and Spanish: setup, options, entities and their states, actions, messages and repairs, the cards with their editors and the caller of the scoreboard. It follows the language of Home Assistant; a regional variant such as `de-CH` or `es-419` counts as its language. Other languages see English.

- Home Assistant names the entities in the language of the server (**Settings → System → General**); states and cards follow the language of your user profile.
- The caller speaks the card's language with a voice of your browser or tablet for that language.
- The documentation is in English and German, the blueprints in English because Home Assistant does not translate blueprints.

To improve a translation or add a language, see [translations in CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#translations).
