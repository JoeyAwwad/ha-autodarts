## In short

One sentence:

```text
Make your Autodarts board part of your smart home: a scoreboard on any tablet, a light show on every 180, a bot, tournaments and stats. Local, no cloud, free.
```

A short description:

```text
Autodarts for Home Assistant is a free, open-source integration that connects an Autodarts board to Home Assistant in real time, locally and without an account. It brings a scoreboard for the tablet at the board, X01, Cricket, party and training games, a bot, tournaments, player statistics with heatmaps, and events for your own automations, such as lights that flash on a 180.
```

## Facts

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Autodarts for Home Assistant (`ha-autodarts`) |
| Price | Free, open source under the MIT license |
| Connection | Local and in real time with the Board Manager on the board PC; no Autodarts account, no cloud |
| Games | X01 from 101 to 1001, four Cricket games, six party games and eight training games |
| Play | Up to four players or two teams of two, handicap start scores, a bot from level 20 to 120, tournaments of three to eight players |
| Scoreboard | A full-screen view for a tablet or TV, with the new game screen, dart corrections, a caller and idle mode |
| Statistics | Personal bests, heatmaps of the real dart positions, trends, achievements, a leaderboard, a weekly report and exports |
| Home | Seven dashboard cards, an automatic dashboard and twelve blueprints, for example a light show on a 180 |

| Quality | 100 % test coverage, tested against both Board Manager generations in Docker; every rule of the Home Assistant quality scale up to Platinum (self-assessed) |
| Requirements | Home Assistant 2026.8 or newer with HACS; the tested setups are under [supported devices](README.md#supported-devices) |
| Online matches | Events straight from the Autodarts cloud follow once Autodarts grants access; until then an experimental bridge through Tools for Autodarts brings them in |

## The story

```text
I play on an Autodarts board myself. I wanted it in Home Assistant, looked for a complete solution for a long time and didn't find one. So I wrote my own, in my spare time. By the community, for the community: I keep developing it, and feedback from real players decides what comes next. – Dennis Otto

## Try it without a board

A demo with a simulated board and made-up players shows every card, the scoreboard and a training history. You need Docker and Git; on Windows, run it in Git Bash.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts.git
cd ha-autodarts
bash tests/e2e/demo.sh
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:18124/autodarts-demo/board>; no login is needed from your own computer. `DEMO_LANGUAGE=de bash tests/e2e/demo.sh` starts it in German. The script prints the command that stops it. More in the [development guide](development.md#demo-instance-and-browser-test).

## Videos and animations

Recorded in the demo with a simulated board. MP4 works in video editors, on Reddit and on Discord; GIF works in every forum.

## How to name it

- Call it **Autodarts for Home Assistant** or **ha-autodarts** and link <https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts>.
- Say that it is an **unofficial community project**, not affiliated with Autodarts. Autodarts and Winmau names and logos belong to their owners; please don't use them in a way that looks like an endorsement, for example in a thumbnail.
- Autodarts no longer supports the local interface of the Board Manager officially from version 2 on. The integration still works with it; the [supported devices](README.md#supported-devices) say what is tested.
