# Autodarts for Home Assistant

![Autodarts logo](branding/icon.svg){ width="96" align="right" }

**Your Autodarts board, live in Home Assistant: local, realtime and ready for automations.**

Darts appear in Home Assistant a fraction of a second after they land, straight from the Board Manager in your network. Play and train with them, put a scoreboard next to the board, follow your statistics and let your home join in. No account, no cloud, no client ID.

## What it does

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-lan-connect:{ .lg .middle } **Local and in realtime**

    ---

    Found automatically with Board Manager 2; Board Manager 1 works too. Nothing leaves your network unless you use the board search, the cloud link or the online bridge, and board secrets are never stored.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: How it works](how-it-works.md)

- :material-bullseye-arrow:{ .lg .middle } **Games**

    ---

    X01 from 101 to 1001 with the checkout route after every dart, Cricket, Cut-Throat Cricket, Tactics and Wild Mouse, and six party games, alone or as a match of up to four with legs, sets, teams and handicaps.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Games and rules](games.md)

- :material-target:{ .lg .middle } **Training**

    ---

    Training sessions that start with the first dart, eight training games from Around the Clock to the JDC Challenge, a daily goal, a training streak and personal bests.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Training games](games.md#training-games)

- :material-monitor-dashboard:{ .lg .middle } **Scoreboard and cards**

    ---

    A scoreboard for a tablet or TV, readable from the oche, with a new game screen, a caller and idle mode. Seven dashboard cards and an automatic dashboard, in English, German, Dutch, French and Spanish.

- :material-tournament:{ .lg .middle } **Tournaments and a bot**

    ---

    Tournaments of three to eight players, as a round robin with a table or a knockout with a bracket, and a bot from level 20 to 120 to play X01 and Cricket against.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Tournaments](games.md#tournaments) · [The bot](games.md#playing-against-the-bot)

- :material-microphone:{ .lg .middle } **Voice**

    ---

    Say "Start 501 for Alex and Sam" to Assist, in English or German, and the game starts. Any game also starts with one action of an automation.
