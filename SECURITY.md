# Security policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest release of the Autodarts integration. Older versions receive no fixes; update through HACS to stay protected.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue, discussion or pull request for a suspected vulnerability. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository:

<https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts/security/advisories/new>

Include the affected version, the Home Assistant version, the Board Manager version, how the board is connected, reproduction steps and the potential impact. Reports in English or German are welcome.

## What happens next

| Step | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Acknowledgement of the report | within 7 days |
| First assessment, including whether the report is accepted | within 14 days |
| Fix released for a confirmed vulnerability | as fast as possible, at the latest within 90 days |
| Public disclosure | when the fixed release is available, in a GitHub security advisory and the release notes |

If a fix needs longer, for example because the cause lies in an upstream project, you receive an update at least every 14 days. Reporters are credited in the advisory and the release notes unless they prefer to stay anonymous.

## Scope

In scope are the integration in `custom_components/autodarts/`, the dashboard cards it serves, the blueprints, and the release and CI workflows of this repository.

Out of scope, and reported to their own projects instead:

- the Autodarts Board Manager, Autodarts Desktop, the Autodarts cloud and their apps: <https://autodarts.io>;
- Home Assistant itself and HACS: <https://www.home-assistant.io/security/> and <https://github.com/hacs/integration/security>.

If you are unsure where a problem belongs, report it here; it will be forwarded with your consent.

## Secrets

Autodarts access and refresh tokens, Board Manager API keys, Home Assistant access tokens, private network addresses, and logs or diagnostics containing those values must never be committed to this repository or posted in public issues.

The integration stores Autodarts tokens only in the Home Assistant config entry. The Board Manager API key returned by the local configuration endpoint is discarded before any value reaches Home Assistant entities. Diagnostics redact the board ID, addresses, client ID, tokens and player names and contain no API keys; the Docker end-to-end test verifies this against a real Home Assistant instance. Every pull request and every push to `main` is scanned with Gitleaks, and CodeQL analyzes the Python code, the card JavaScript and the workflows.

## How the project keeps itself secure

- Every pull request and every push to `main` runs CodeQL, a Gitleaks secret scan and, for changed dependencies, a review against known vulnerabilities. OpenSSF Scorecard checks the practices of the repository every week.
- Actions are pinned to commit hashes, tokens get the least permissions they need, and Renovate keeps actions, dependencies and images current, with the updates that fix a vulnerability at once.
- OSV-Scanner checks every lock file against the OSV database of known vulnerabilities, on every pull request and every week.
- Harden-Runner records the network traffic of every job of the workflows, so that a connection that doesn't belong there shows.
- Releases carry an SBOM as SPDX and as CycloneDX, the licenses of their third-party components (`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`), an OpenVEX document of the advisories that the project accepts with their reasons, and the signed provenance of an isolated build (SLSA Build Level 3); their tags are signed without a key by the release workflow (gitsign); they are immutable once published and are verified as their users can after every release and every week.

## Findings of code scanning

CodeQL and OpenSSF Scorecard report their findings in the repository's Security tab. The Findings workflow of the [issue assistant](https://github.com/Dennis-Otto/issue-assistant#findings) dismisses the findings that `.github/findings.toml` accepts, each with its reason, and fails while any other finding is open. It names an open finding only by the number and link of its alert, which only maintainers can open; nothing about a possible vulnerability becomes a public issue.

## Verify a release

A release is immutable once it is published, and GitHub signs an attestation of it that ties its tag to its commit and to every file it carries. The release workflow also signs the build provenance of every file with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/), using a certificate for the workflow of this repository that is valid for ten minutes. No long-lived signing key exists, so none can leak, and none is stored where the releases are downloaded. The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) checks both signatures with the public keys of GitHub and Sigstore, which it fetches itself:

```sh
gh release verify vX.Y.Z --repo Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts
gh release download vX.Y.Z --repo Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts --pattern autodarts.zip
gh attestation verify autodarts.zip --repo Dennis-Otto/ha-autodarts
```

## Assurance case

This section argues why the way the project is changed, built and delivered meets the requirements of this policy. The software itself, what it protects, where its trust boundaries lie when it runs and which risks remain, is the subject of [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).

### Threat model

An attacker would most likely try to bring malicious code into `main`, through a pull request or through a dependency, an action or an image; to make a workflow run code that it shouldn't run, or leak a secret; to replace a release on its way to the users; or to keep a known vulnerability in a release. A report of a vulnerability is itself sensitive until its fix is released.

### Trust boundaries

1. **Outside contributors → pull requests.** Their code is untrusted. The workflows of their pull requests run only after the maintainer approves them, with a read-only token and without secrets.
2. **Pull requests → `main`.** A change reaches `main` only through a pull request that passes every required check, squashed into one signed commit. The rules of `main` and of the release tags have no exceptions, not even for administrators.
3. **`main` → secrets.** Every secret lives in an environment that only workflows on `main` can use, and the jobs that use one run no code of a pull request.
4. **Third-party code → the build.** Dependencies are pinned by version and hash, actions by commit hash and images by digest. An update waits a week after its release, unless it fixes a vulnerability, and passes the same checks as every other change.
5. **The release → its users.** The release workflow builds every release from its tagged commit; GitHub keeps it immutable, and its signatures let users check it, as [Verify a release](#verify-a-release) shows.
6. **Issues → the issue assistant.** Anyone can write an issue, so its text is data for an AI that only reads; a job without the AI checks the answer before anything is posted.

### Secure design principles

- **Least privilege:** tokens are read-only unless a job needs more, and then get only what it needs; each secret is in the one environment that needs it.
- **Fail-safe defaults:** a failed check, a missing secret or an open finding stops a merge or a release instead of being skipped; workflows of outside contributors wait for approval.
- **Complete mediation:** every change of `main` passes the same required checks, and nobody can bypass the rules of `main` and of the release tags.
- **Separation of privilege:** the job in which the AI reads untrusted text, such as an issue, holds no token that writes, and the job that writes runs no AI; only the release workflow on `main` publishes releases.
- **Least common mechanism:** the secrets of the releases and those of the issue assistant are in separate environments, so a job that needs one never holds the other.
- **Economy of mechanism:** one script, `scripts/check.sh`, runs the checks locally and in the CI; one workflow builds, signs and publishes every release.
- **Open design:** the workflows, the settings as code and this policy are public; the protection relies on no secret about how it works.
- **Psychological acceptability:** the dev container has every tool of the checks, and the hook before every push runs the same checks as the CI, so the secure way is the easy one.

### Common weaknesses

How the [OWASP Top 10 CI/CD security risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-ci-cd-security-risks/) are countered:

| Risk | Countermeasure |
| --- | --- |
| Insufficient flow control mechanisms | pull requests only, every required check, a linear history, release tags that never move |
| Inadequate identity and access management | administrator access only for the maintainers; bots act as GitHub Apps or with the token of their workflow |
| Dependency chain abuse | lock files with hashes, pins by commit hash and digest, updates only a week after their release, the dependency review and OSV-Scanner |
| Poisoned pipeline execution | no code of a pull request runs with a secret; actionlint and zizmor audit every workflow |
| Insufficient pipeline-based access controls | permissions per job, environments that only `main` can use, actions pinned to commit hashes as a setting of the repository |
| Insufficient credential hygiene | the secret scan and push protection, tokens of the release app that expire after an hour, no secret printed or committed |
| Insecure system configuration | the settings as code, which the settings bot applies after every change and every week, and OpenSSF Scorecard every week |
| Ungoverned usage of third-party services | only the services of the workflows in this repository, each in the jobs that need it, with the least permissions |
| Improper artifact integrity validation | immutable releases with signed provenance, verified after every release and every week |
| Insufficient logging and visibility | the logs of every run, and Harden-Runner, which records the network traffic of every job |

In the code, CodeQL looks for the weaknesses of the [CWE Top 25](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/) with its extended security queries, on every pull request and every push to `main`. How the code counters the weaknesses that matter for it is part of [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).
